Section 3:

Tasks by Members: This section is a chart displaying the distribution of tasks among team members. Each horizontal bar represents an individual, with tasks categorized as 'Completed' (green) and 'Not Started' (blue). The names on the y-axis seem to be the team members, with corresponding task counts on the x-axis.

Status: Showing a total of 145 with trends for weekly and daily changes.
Meeting Actions: A large number indicating actions or items generated from meetings, with a bar chart showing day visits.

Tasks Completion Donut Chart: At the bottom right, there is a donut chart displaying the total number of tasks  with a percentage and number breakdown of 'Completed' and 'Not Started' tasks.

Colors Use: 
Green: This color is used to represent completed tasks or positive trends. It’s a universal color for indicating success and completion. In this dashboard, it appears in various shades, from light to dark, which may help differentiate between different states or values of completion.

Blue: Various shades of blue are used to indicate tasks that have not started or are in progress. Blue is often associated with professionalism and trustworthiness. In the context of this UI, it seems to differentiate tasks that are pending or in an inactive state.

White: The primary background color is white, which creates a clean and uncluttered look. It helps in making the colorful elements and data points stand out and enhances readability.

Black: Used sparingly for text, providing a strong contrast against the white background for high readability.

Red and Green Arrows: Small arrows in red and green show negative and positive trends, respectively. The red color typically signifies a negative, while green signifies an positive change.
